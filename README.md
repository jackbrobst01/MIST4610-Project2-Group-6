## Scenario Description:

The task for our project is to design and build a database for an online retail company. The main focus of the database is the Customer entity, who can browse products, add products to their cart, and purchase the items. Some of the other entities consist of Product, Cart, Order, Payment, Shipper, and Address, which all work together to help track the shopping process. The goal was to design this model in a way that represents how an e-commerce store would work in real life. After creating the model, we populated it with data to represent business activity and then made 5 complex SQL queries to answer questions with the data that real managers would find helpful.
